# Data Set Description & What it Contains
This data set is titled “Real Estate Sales 2001-2020” and was obtained on the data.gov website. This data set contains all real estate sales that took place between 2001 and 2020 in the state of Connecticut. Additionally each sale that is included must have been above two-thousand dollars. In terms of dimensions, this real estate data has 13 columns and 997,213 rows of data. The data that each on of these columns contains are, the serial number of the sale, the list year of the property, the date the sale was recorded, the town the property is located in, the address of the property, the assessed value of the property, the sale value of the property, the ratio of property assessed value to property sale value, the type of property, if that property is residential then the type of residential property, accessor remarks, OPM (Office of Personnel Management) remarks, and finally specific geographic location. Also, it should be noted that the accessor remark data column refers to remarks of local government officials that assess the value of a property and the OPM remarks is regarding the remarks of the Office of Personnel Management, which manages government officials in a quasi-human resource role.

# Question 1
How has the average sale price per year changed of one family, two family, and three family homes in Hartford, Bridgeport, and Connecticut as a whole from 2007-2020?

# Question 2
How does the unemployment rate and median income relate to the difference in sale amount and assessed value?

# Question 1 Importance
This question is important to consider because real estate prices fluctuate depending on whether the home is a single, two, or three family home and its location. By utilizing sale price and looking at it alongside these two measures over a 13 year period, we are able to see a few major trends emerge. This visualization could be useful for people interested in moving to Connecticut who are trying to determine what town or living arrangement they are searching for. Multi-family homes are not as common in the United States as they are in other parts of the world which means that our data can help identify areas of opportunity for those looking to move into this area. Comparing these prices across different geographic locations can also help local and state governments assess how prices are different and how they can better accommodate or attract multi family units. This can help states like Connecticut continue to grow their population and help diversify it as well. Comparing one, two, and three family homes can help identify these trends for those interested in buying and/or building homes as well as give a good idea as to how much they will sell for. 

# Question 2 Importance
This question is interesting to examine because real estate prices fluctuate greatly depending on primary economic indicators like the unemployment rate and median income. This data is useful for someone looking to buy or sell a home or a real estate agent because it shows how big of an impact primary economic indicators can have on the residual between the average sales price and assessed value. This data and information can be beneficial for home builders and anyone in real estate who needs to know what they can expect a home to sell for by looking at a commonly reported metric like the unemployment rate. This information is helpful for buyers and sellers alike who want to know what they can expect from the housing market and when is a good time to buy or sell. This can lead to helping people decide when the best time is to buy a home in Connecticut to get the best value on a house, or as a seller, get the best price on a house. 

# Data Set Manipulations

-*Question One* used the average selling price and how it changed across one, two, and three family homes in two cities and the state of Connecticut. This was already provided in the data set, but the data was manipulated to compare how the prices changed over time based on these variables, and then visualized to provide more clarity on how exactly the average selling price differs. Towns were filtered to focus on the specific cities and provide an accurate visualization of the data. The year column was also filtered so that it only provided data from 2007-2020 so that data from all 3 towns could be compared in every single year.

-In *Question Two* a residual was calculated by taking the difference between the averaged assessed value for a year and the average selling price for the year to create a data point. This was accomplished by creating a calculated field and using the formula '[sale value]'-'[assessed value]'. The purpose of this was to use the residual to evaluate the unemployment rate on the difference between these two variables. A positive residual would show average selling price to be higher, while a negative would show average assessed value to be higher. Comparing the residuals to the unemployment rate over a span of time allows more insight for real estate market. To compare the residual to the unemployment rate in the same graph, we created a dual axis by checking the dual axis box on the y axis. This data was filtered in the year column to ensure that the data presented was present in both the unemployment rate dataset and the residual dataset for each year.


# Question 1 Analysis

Our visualizations show that the average sales price of a single family home in Connecticut as a whole is much greater than the average price of a single family home in the towns of Bridgeport and Hartford respectively. It is also interesting to break this data down by the type of home because two and three family home prices look much different than the one family home prices - the average sales prices of two and three family homes in Connecticut is about the same as the average sales price of two and three family homes in both the towns of Bridgeport and Hartford. From the data, we can also conclude that single family homes had the highest average selling price over two and three family homes no matter the location of the home. One of the most evident factors is the lack of growth in the real estate market of Connecticut over the past 20 years in all 3 categories as average prices have stayed near stagnant.

# Question 2 Analysis

The relationship between the unemployment rate and the residual of sale price and assessed value is an inverse relationship, as the unemployment rate rising is an indicator that the economy is experiencing a downturn. When the unemployment rate increases, the average selling price of homes will be expected to decrease because demand for buying luxury goods like real estate decreases. Our visualization shows that as the unemployment rate increases, the residual between the sale amount and assessed value decreases. This can be explained by the fact that sales price decreases and gets closer to the assessed value as economic conditions worsen. In 2010 when the unemployment rate peaked at 9.5%, the residual reached a minimum of $-50,000 which shows that the average selling price was lower than the average assessed value. The opposite is true for the median income which has a direct relationship with the residual, as the demand for luxury goods like real estate increase as income increases, driving sales prices up. The graph shows that the peaks for each residual became greater and greater as median income continued to increase, establishing a relationship between the two variables. The visualization shows that until 2016, as the median income increases the residual increases as well. After 2016 it is important to note that the correlation drops off, hinting that there may be other factors at play.
